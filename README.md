# Meeple CafÃ©

This was my front-end project that I completed at Northcoders bootcamp. It is a board game review website that can be both used on desktop and mobile and uses the api I created during by back-end project. Users may post reviews on any board game, comment on other user's reviews and like/dislike other user's comments and reviews. The name was inspired by the many board game cafes that have recently popped up all over many cities and the general aesthetic formed from there. There are a couple of pages that are currently quite bare, but once I've added the endpoints to the api, they will contain more components. I also want to do more work on the up and down vote system, with the trending reviews and the sort/filter reviews.

### Note the CSS has currently only been designed to be used on mobile, but a desktop version will be released soon!
